## I study the tectonic boundaries that lie beneath our oceans using earthquake observations. 

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, supervised by Dr. William Wilcock. Before coming to the University of Washington in September 2019, I earned a B.A. in Physics with a Geophysics emphasis from Colorado College in May 2019.

I'm starting to think about postdoc opportunities-- feel free to reach out!
