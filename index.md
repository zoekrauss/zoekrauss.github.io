## I use earthquakes to study the tectonic boundaries that lie beneath our oceans. 

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, supervised by Dr. William Wilcock. Before coming to the University of Washington in September 2019, I earned a B.A. in Physics with a Geophysics emphasis from Colorado College in May 2019.

I'm starting to think about postdoc opportunities-- feel free to reach out!

## News and Updates
__March 2024__: The Endeavour segment experienced the highest earthquake rates seen in 20 years on March 6, with nearly 2,000 earthquakes occurring alongside a 4.1 magnitude mainshock. This made the news and we got to get the word out about our backyard mid-ocean ridge! Read about it in the [Vancouver Sun](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/flurry-of-mini-earthquakes-off-vancouver-island-hints-at-undersea-expansion/wcm/a9e40553-740c-41f7-a274-e0674563ab5d/amp/), [CBC Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/earthquakes-deepsea-eruption-magma-vancouver-island-bc-1.7140915), and [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earthquakes/2000-earthquakes-in-1-day-off-canada-coast-suggest-the-ocean-floor-is-ripping-apart-scientists-say). 

__August 2023:__ Our paper on building commercial cloud resources for seismology workflows was published in [Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/979)!

__February 2023:__ I successfully passed my Generals exam and became a Ph.D. candidate!

__January 2023:__ The paper for the 20-year earthquake catalog we built for the Endeavour segment was [published open access in JGR](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JB025662)!
